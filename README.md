# pyMDB
Simple code split into two files

pyMDB.py uses OMDBApi to grab random imdb titles and possibly do some exploratory data analysis

suggest.py uses Kivy to create a window, pulls out a random TOP 250 title and then displays the title

## All this cause my girlfriend can't pick out a film to watch if her life depended on it
